Go to https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk

Click on libraries

Click sky130_fd_pr

Click latest @ f62031a

In the right corner click on code and copy the link and use the command 
"git clone https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_pr.git" in the terminal


then go to the folder skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_pr manually in your machine

enter the folder "cells" 

In that enter "nfet_01v8" folder

copy the file "sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8__tt.pm3.spice" file.


In the mean time create a new folder called spice_lib folder in the work_dir folder and paste that file in that folder.


enter the folder "cells" 

In that enter pfet_01v8" folder

copy the file "sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8__tt.pm3.spice" file and paste it in spice Lib folder.



in skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_pr/ folder enter models folder and then in parameters folder

copy invariant.spice file and lod.spice file and paste it in spice Lib folder.


now its time to create our own library by the name sky130.lib.

Steps:
being in the terminal cd spice_lib
use the command nano skulib30.lib
in that include all the 4 files copied in spice_lib folder usig the commands

*comment:skylib.30
.include invariant.spice 
.include lod.spice
.include sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8__tt.pm3.spice
.include sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8__tt.pm3.spice


ctrl+s 

you should see a message 5 lines have been written

ctrl+x




Steps to install MAGIC

go to http://opencircuitdesign.com/


on left panel, you wll see a tab called Magic, click on that, in that click on Donwload

in that use the git link mentioned under the title "Source Distribution Git Repository"

copy the link "git clone git://opencircuitdesign.com/magic" in the terminal.

Now we need to install the dependencies, for that you will find the commands to install the depencies in the install page of magic website.


go to https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks on browser 






In order to extract the parasitics use the command.

Lets say, we want to know the parasitics of FD(Frequency Divider) block,
use the command i to selecte all the layout in the current window
then
in the console type 
extract all

*A message Extracting FD into FD.ext* will be displayed

then use the command
ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0
ext2spice
*A message exttospice finished* will be displayed.

Few points to note:

In the command
"ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0"

cthresh 0 rthresh 0 --> means any amount of resistive and capacitive effect present will be extracted.
If we mention as 1fF means extarct the paasitice greater than 1fF.  



If we open up the FD.spice file which is the extracted version, we can see lot of additional capacitances extracted by magic, these are parasitics
Few other parameters in this file are area of drain(ad), perimeter of drain(pd) etc.

We also see a scale factor being mentined on top.

.option scale indicates a multiplication factor thae needs to be multiplied with all the parameter.

We know that the minimum length when we use skywater is L=150nm, 
and if we mention L=15 the scale factor must be choosen as 10n

A total of 84 parasitic capacitance for VCO
43 for FD
47 for PFD
68 for CP
 can be observed from .spice files.



For post layout simulation

run the command
nano PFD_postlay.cir

and type the following

.include spice_lib/sky130.lib
.include PFD.spice

XX1 Ref_clk Up Down clk2 GND VDD PFD

v1 VDD GND 1.8
v2 Ref_clk 0 PULSE 0 1.8 0n 6p 6p 40ns 80ns
v3 Clk2 0 PULSE 0 1.8 1n 6p 6p 40ns 80ns


.control
tran 0.1ns 5us
plot v(Up) v(Down)+2 v(Ref_clk)+4 v(clk2)+6
.endc

.end
